# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION :

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on their features. The steps involved in the project include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Visualisation
5. Encode Categorical columns
6. Splitting Data into Training & Testing
7. Logistic Regression & Model Training
8. Evaluating & Testing the Model

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). 
It consists of two CSV files:

- `train.csv`: Training data with features and the target variable (Survived).
- `test.csv`: Test data with features only.

- `Titanic.csv`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Contains the results of the analysis, including visualizations and reports.

## Usage

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    Open the  file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to explore the data and gain insights.

2. Preprocess the Data:

    Run the script to preprocess the data.

3. Train the Model:

    Run the script to train the machine learning model.

4. Evaluate the Model:

    Run the script to evaluate the model and generate reports.
   

## Results

The results of the model evaluation, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, can be found in the ` file.
